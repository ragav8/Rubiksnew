<br>HOW TO SOLVE THE RUBIK'S CUBE
<br>cube Notation

Solving the cube will require you to turn its faces. Each face is represented by a letter. The direction of a given rotation is denoted by the presence or absence of a prime (’) symbol.

Right face: R
Left face: L
Upward-pointing face: U
Downward-pointing face: D
Front face: F
Back face: B

R, L, U, D, F, or B means to turn the corresponding face 90 degrees clockwise

R’, L’, U’, D’, F’, or B’ means to turn the corresponding face 90 degrees counterclockwise.

R2, L2, U2, D2, F2, or B2 means to turn the corresponding face 180 degrees.

Step One: Make the Daisy
<br>It should look like this

<br>Note: It doesn’t matter what color the grey squares are. Two things to keep in mind:

Once a white sticker is placed next to the yellow center, it does not need to be moved.
You can turn the top layer without disturbing anything next to the yellow center.
Step Two: Create the White Cross

For each petal on the “daisy,” match the non-white sticker to the center piece of the same color. Once matched, turn the face with the matching center two times. Repeat this process three more times. When you are finished, the bottom face of the cube will have a white cross.

Note: For the rest of the solve, the white cross will be on the bottom. If you ever find the white cross somewhere else, something has gone wrong.

Step Three: Solve the First Layer

Time to learn your first algorithms. The following “trigger moves” are the most basic of the bunch:

Right Trigger = R U R’
Left Trigger = L’ U’ L
Look for white stickers on the top layer
<br> that face the sides. (If you find a white sticker on the top face of the cube, or on the bottom layer of the cube pointing outward, we’ll 
<br>deal with it later.) Each white sticker should be on a corner piece with three stickers. Rotate the top face of the cube so that the sticker beside the white sticker that is also outward facing (i.e., not the sticker on the top) diagonally matches the center of the same color.
